Dicaeopolis works in the field * for he is digging the field.
The work is large and difficult * for he carries the stones out of the field.
He lifts and carries a big stone to the stone heap.
The man is strong but he works much time and he is very tired.
For the sun is blazing and wears him out.
And so he sits under the tree and he does not rest for much time.
For soon he lifts himself and works.
And finally the sun sets.
And so Dicaeopolis no longer works but goes home.
