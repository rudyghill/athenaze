Dicaeopolis is an Athenian * and Dicaeopolis does not live in Athens but in the country * for he is a farmer.
And so he cultivates the farm and works in the fields.
And hard is his life * for his farm is small, and large is his work.
And so Dicaeopolis always works and often groans and says "O Zeus, my life is hard, for my work is endless, and my farm is small and does not provide much grain."
But the man is strong and energetic * and so he rejoices often * for he is free and a farmer * and he loves his home.
For his farm is beautiful and it does not provide much grain but enough.
