Dicaeopolis steps out of the house and calls Xanthias.
Xanthias is a slave, on the one hand a strong man, on the other hand lazy * for he does not work unless Dicaeopolis is present.
But now he sleeps in the house.
And so Dicaeopolis calls him and says "Come here Xanthias. Why do you sleep? Don't be so lazy but hurry."
And so Xanthias steps out of the house slowly and says "Why are you so difficult master; for I am not lazy but am already hurrying."
But Dicaeopolis says "Come here and help for take the plow and carry it to the field for I drive the oxen.
But hurry for although the field is small, the work is large.
